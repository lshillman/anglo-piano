# Anglo Piano

Anglo Piano is a learning and composition tool for Anglo concertina players. This repo is a vanilla JS re-implementation of the first [anglo piano](https://anglopiano.com), which was built in Axure RP. Definitely not ready for prime time yet. See current progress [here](https://lshillman.github.io/anglo-piano/).

## Features, bugs, etc.

If you have an idea for a feature or think you've found a bug, post a message to [this thread](https://www.concertina.net/forums/index.php?/topic/24636-anglo-piano-webapp/) or message me directly on that forum.

## License

The eventual plan is for this to be open-source-ish (exact details TBD), but for now, talk to me if you want to use this.
