Anglo Piano is a learning, composition, and layout exploration tool for Anglo concertina players. You can use it to figure out how to play difficult melodies and chords, design and share your ideal keyboard layout, or just use it as a reference to compare different concertinas.

## Current features

* Select a note on either the piano or the concertina keyboards to see all instances of that note highlighted on both keyboards.
* By default, notes absent from the concertina keyboard are grayed out on the piano keyboard. This helps you get a bird's-eye view of the tradeoffs between different keyboard layouts.
* Customize the view: select from several popular concertina layouts, hide or show labels, color-code octaves, limit the display to one bellows direction.
* Edit any of the built-in layouts to suit your needs, or build one from scratch. Your layouts are stored locally so you can easily return to them. You can also get a link to any layout to bookmark or share with others (I strongly recommend bookmarking your own layouts in case you clear your browser data and wipe out the locally-stored layouts).

## License

The eventual plan is for this to be open-source-ish (exact details TBD), but for now, please talk to me if you want to use this.
