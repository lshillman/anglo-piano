# Anglo Piano

Anglo Piano is a learning and composition tool for Anglo concertina players. This repo is a vanilla JS re-implementation of the first [anglo piano](https://anglopiano.com), which was built in Axure RP. Definitely not ready for prime time yet. See current progress [here](https://lshillman.github.io/anglo-piano/).
